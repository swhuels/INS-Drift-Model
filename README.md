# INS-Drift-Model
Modeling the drift of a submarine's INS over a full patrol cycle with GPS updates every 30 days. 
We use equations found in Bunn and Tsipis' text Ballistic Missile Guidance and Technical Uncertainties of Countersilo Attacks. 
The values of error are likely far larger than in reality due to the lack of access to specific technical details of INS systems, 
as these details are very highly classified. Choices in parameters of the guidance system were made as educated guesses based on 
literature review of publicly available material.
