# INS-Drift-Model
Modeling the drift of a submarine's INS over a full patrol cycle with GPS updates every 30 days. 
We use equations derived by Lucas Arthur of the MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy. 
The values of error are likely far larger than in reality due to the lack of access to specific technical details of INS systems, 
as these details are very highly classified. Choices in parameters of the guidance system were made as educated guesses based on 
literature review of publicly available material.
